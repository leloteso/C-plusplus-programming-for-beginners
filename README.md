**helloworld.cpp**
================================================================
If you're new to programming, this tutorial will show you how to program from scratch using c++ programming language using a simple example with comprehensive explanations.

Note:
1. Any line that starts with /* and ends with */ are comments, it doesn't make any changes to your code. Allows the programmer to add a description about the code. It's also called multiline comment. 
2. Anything after double forward slash or // to the end of the line is also considered to be  a single line comment of the code.

Line 6 defines the scope of the identifiers used in the program.

The iostream header file should be included at the beginning of all programs that use input/output statements.

This code contains only one function, main ().

Every c++ program must have main() function.

As usual, execution begins at main() function.

The statement on line 8 causes the string in quotation marks to be displayed on the screen.

In c++, every main function should end with a return(0) statement, otherwise a warning or an error can occur.

**Reading-user-input.cpp**
================================================================================================================================================================================


Now we've got four statements within the main function, these are:

* Line 4 is used to declare a variable with an integer data type,
* Line 5 to give instructions to the user,
* Line 6 to read input from the user and
* Line 7 to display the user input back to the screen. 

**ifStatement.cpp**
================================================================================================================================================================================

* Line 4 and 5 are used to declear and intialize the variable
* Line 6 checks for the condition if the expression given to if statmenet is true, then the if block will be executed, 
* Otherwise the else block will be executed 
* Note:
  else part doesn't take any condition expression like the 'if'
